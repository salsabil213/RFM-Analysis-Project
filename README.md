# 📊 RFM Analysis - Unlocking Customer Insights!

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to **RFM Analysis**, where we dive into customer behavior using data-driven insights! 🎯 This project helps businesses understand their customers better by categorizing them based on their **Recency (R)**, **Frequency (F)**, and **Monetary (M)** behaviors. Get ready to uncover your **VIP customers** and spot those who need a little nudge to come back! 🛍️💡

## 📂 Dataset
We work with transactional data containing:
- 🆔 **Customer ID** - Who made the purchase?
- 📅 **Invoice Date** - When did they shop?
- 🧾 **Invoice Number** - Unique transaction identifier.
- 💰 **Monetary Value** - How much did they spend?

## 🔍 How It Works
### 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removing duplicates & missing values.
- Formatting data types.
- Extracting relevant fields for analysis.

### 🏆 RFM Score Calculation
- **Recency (R)**: How long since their last purchase?
- **Frequency (F)**: How often do they shop?
- **Monetary (M)**: How much do they spend?

### 🎯 Customer Segmentation
- Assigning scores based on **quantiles**.
- Categorizing customers into different segments (e.g., **VIPs, Frequent Buyers, At-Risk Customers**).

## 🔥 Key Insights
- Identify your **most loyal customers** 🏅.
- Spot those who **might churn** and need re-engagement. ⚠️
- Create **personalized marketing campaigns** 🎯 to boost retention and revenue!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
